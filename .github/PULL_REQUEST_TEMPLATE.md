## Summary

<!-- What does this PR change and why? -->

## Docs sync checklist

User-facing changes must keep README, site, roadmap, and install scripts aligned. See [`docs/SYNC.md`](../docs/SYNC.md).

- [ ] README claims match what `cargo run -p f00-cli -- --help` shows
- [ ] Site does not advertise unshipped features as done
- [ ] ROADMAP status bits match open/closed milestones
- [ ] `install.sh` and `site/install.sh` are byte-identical (or intentionally generated from one source)
- [ ] No broken badge/repo links (`theesfeld/f00`, `https://f00.sh`)

## When you change user-facing behavior

1. Update CLI help / flag surface in code.
2. Update **README.md** (features table, usage, shipped vs planned labels).
3. Update **site/index.html** (feature cards, demos, roadmap strip).
4. Update **docs/ROADMAP.md** milestone status.
5. Comment on or close related **GitHub Issues**; open new ones for follow-ups.
6. If install/release URLs change, update **install.sh** and **site/install.sh** together (keep them identical).

## Test plan

- [ ] `cargo test` (workspace)
- [ ] Manual smoke: `cargo run -p f00-cli -- -la`
